A modular agent based system that converts product data into structured content using deterministic, explainable logic. Built with reusable blocks, clear templates, and testable pipelines to generate FAQ, product and comparison pages with maintainable, production ready design.

An AI Agentic Content Generation System is a modular, production oriented repository that transforms small product datasets into structured, machine readable content pages using an agent based orchestration pattern. The system ingests a normalized product JSON, converts it into a typed internal model and runs a configurable automation graph composed of single responsibility agents: Parser, QuestionGenerator, ContentBlockBuilder, TemplateRenderer, Comparator and JSONExporter. Each agent receives explicit input, returns deterministic outputs and contains no hidden global state enabling testability and reusability. Content logic is organized into reusable blocks (e.g, benefits_block, usage_block, safety_block, compare_ingredients_block) that encapsulate business rules and formatting concerns. Templates are declarative JSON schema like definitions that describe required fields, block dependencies and rendering rules. The TemplateEngine composes blocks according to templates to produce consistent outputs for FAQ, Product and Comparison pages.
This repository emphasizes clarity: code is modular with clear folder boundaries (agents/, blocks/, templates/, pipelines/, docs/), a concise README explaining design decisions and diagrams illustrating the DAG based orchestration. The system ships with deterministic rule based, explainable content generation (no external data calls) and a small fixture dataset (GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum and a fictional Product B) to demonstrate correctness and JSON output quality.
Output pages are machine readable JSON files suitable for downstream indexing, search or static site generation.
The assignment demonstrates engineering trade offs: preference for rule based, explainable content generation over opaque LLM prompting emphasis on maintainability and testability and an extendable template/block taxonomy for future feature addition. Included are unit test scaffolds, example pipeline runs and instructions to extend the system with new agents or templates during code review regularly.
